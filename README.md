# Study-App
This app is simple project I started in 2020.
It's an app designed to assist students with their studies.
It is far from finished.
Right now the app has three features: a timer, a to-do list, and the ability to save and load to-do lists.
In future updates you will be able to: pause the timer, sort your to-do list by different categories, and recieve reminders about tasks whose deadlines are fast approaching.
Eventually, I hope to update the app with a more user friendly interface.
At the moment, this project is on hold indefinitely while I focus on my education.
